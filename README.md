# umun-framework

## About

`umun-framework` is a powerful tool for creating full-stack web applications rapidly. It leverages the intuitive GUI of [Umun Studio](https://studio.umun.in) to allow developers to define reusable libraries and portals quickly and efficiently.

### Key Features

- **Reusable Libraries**: Define entities and entity relations that can be reused across different applications.

- **Portals**: Create full-screen components that have multiple pages in them. Each page can be mapped to an entity, and the framework automatically creates pages for each entity.

- **Customizable**: Update pages, views, and business logic as per your needs.

- **Code Export**: Download the workspace containing all the backend code in Spring Boot and the front-end code in Angular. Modify the code as required - there is no vendor lock-in.

- **Flexible Deployment**: Deploy the code on any platform of your choice.

### Motivation

The `umun-framework` was born out of a desire to balance product development with client projects at [Umun Tech](https://www.umun.in). It encapsulates years of full-stack experience into a single, streamlined framework that accelerates development and enhances productivity.
